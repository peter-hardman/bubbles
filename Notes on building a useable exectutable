We want to use pyinstaller to build a single executable from the code.

pip install pyinstaller


The following command executed in the terminal will build the exe from the script main.py
pyinstaller --onefile  main.py

The large .exe file is created in a directory called dist inside the project directory.

For this example the main.exe file is 36M in size !

To make the complete .exe into a screensaver rename to *.scr  and then copy to Windows/System32 folder.
